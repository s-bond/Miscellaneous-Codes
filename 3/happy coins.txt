The most important thing to note out here is that the order of coins doesn’t matter.

But how? Can you prove it?

Lets say that lxh is ‘-’(negative) and hhb is ‘+’(positive). Is our assumption correct? 
We’ll see…..According to the problem, if the chosen coins belong to the same person, the new coin will belong to
hhb else lxh. Going with our assumption, 
if the two signs are same it will result in ‘+’(hhb) else ‘-’(lxh),
 which is obviously true. So irrespective of the order of coins chosen, 
 if the number of ‘-’ coins is even it will result in ‘+’ else ‘-’.

So we can see if the number of coins initially belonging to lxh is even, it will finally belong to hhb else lxh.
